## Abstract
Nowadays the news are distorted, we can observe many variation between diferent social medias. This variation could be interpreted as freedom of expresion but also show ,in some cases, a sick society where social medias are more a narsicistic business rather than an entity that understand their power and priorize the quality of the information.
FNews is an open source project, our objective is to show the divergence of information posted between social medias giving to people the option to know, to judge, to choice. Imagine a software than scrapes the news in textual and vocal form, a tool that  compares the news getting the variance of information from news anounced in different S.M, shows strange patterns between S.M and rate S.M using some algorithm. If you believe in our purpose you and you want to help you are welcome.
