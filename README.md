# FNews
## Abstract
Nowadays the news are distorted, we can observe many variation between diferent medias. This variation could be interpreted as freedom of expression but also show ,in some cases, a sick society where medias are more a narssicistic business rather than an entity that understand their power and priorize the quality of the information.
FNews is an open source project wich aims to show the divergence of information posted between medias giving to people the option to know, to judge, to choose. Imagine a software that scrapes the news in textual and vocal form, a tool that  compares the news getting the variance of information from news anounced in different medias, shows strange patterns between medias and rate medias using some algorithm. If you believe in our purpose and you want to help you are welcome.
